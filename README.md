Statistical Machine Learning

## IRLS
Iterative reweighted least squares method solving Logistic Regression. Also forked IRLS_tf from wangg12.

## Mixture Multinomial Model
Implement an EM algorithm to learn the parameters {\pi_k, \mu_{kw}} of mixture multinomial model and test it on the nips dataset.

## Variational Inference
Gaussian Mixture model and VAE, implement the generative model with [ZhuSuan](https://github.com/thu-ml/zhusuan).
